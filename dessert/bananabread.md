# Banana bread

###Ingredients

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2/3 cup sugar
3 very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed with a fork (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup walnut pieces


###Method

1. Sift the flour, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. Whisk the eggs and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup with a spout and set aside. Lightly brush a loaf pan with butter. Preheat the oven to 160 degrees Celcius.

2. Cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with a hand-held mixer) until light and fluffy. Gradually pour the egg mixture into the butter, while mixing, until incorporated. Add the bananas, and remove the bowl from the mixer.

3. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the nuts and transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool the bread in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Turn the bread out of the pan and let cool completely on the rack.
