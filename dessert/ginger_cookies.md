Ginger Cookie Recipe

INGREDIENTS

4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 cups butter, room temperature
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup honey
3/4 cup coarse sugar or granulated sugar

METHOD

1 In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, ginger, baking soda,
cinnamon, cardamom, and salt; set aside.

2 In a large mixing bowl beat together butter with 1 cup of white
sugar. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat
in eggs, honey and brown sugar. Beat in the flour mixture, using a
wooden spoon.

3 Shape dough into table tennis sized balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet.

4 Bake in a 160Â°C oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until cookies are light
brown and puffed. Cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer cookies
to a wire rack to cool. Store in a tightly covered container at room
temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.


NOTE
The butter temperature is one of the most important factors here. Use room temperature butter. Don't cheat.
