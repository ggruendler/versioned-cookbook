#Donuts

- 5 dl of milk
- 50 g of yeast
- 1.5 dl of sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tl of cardamom
- 150 g of butter
- 1 l of oil for frying
- sugar for coating

1. Mix the yeast with body temperature milk. Mix with eggs, sugar salt and flour and finally molten butter. Stir the dough well and let it stay for 20 minutes in a warm draftless place under a cloth.
2. Form into approximately 45 round buns and let them rise under a cloth for approximately 10 minutes.
3. Deep fry approximately 4 buns at a time in hot oil. When one side is nicely brown, turn over and fry the other side. Lift the buns onto a tissue paper to remove excess fat and roll buns in sugar in a paper bag.
