# Oven Ice cream for ten

Cake dough:
- 5 eggs
- ~2 dl wheat flour
- ~2 dl sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder

Filling (for example):
- Two bananas
- Three kiwis
- One seeded pomegranate
- 5 dl blueberry ice cream
- 5 dl vanilla ice cream

Icing:
- 6 eggs
- 2 dl sugar

1. Blend the cake dough: first break the eggs, and whip them well. Add sugar and blend well, finally mix the flour with the baking powder and add into the mix. The exact measure for the ingredients depends on the size of the eggs, use 1:1:1, the same amount of all three ingredients.
2. Pour the cake dough into a form bake in an oven at 225 degrees for 15 minutes.
3. Let the cake cool. Typically the cake forms a hump in the middle, level it off with a knife.
4. Prepare the meringue icing. Break the eggs, separate the eggwithe and discard yolks. Whip the eggwhites into a foam so stiff that you can turn the bowl downright without making a mess. Add sugar and blend well.
5. Cut the fillings and add on top of the cake, first the fruits or berries, then ice cream on top. Finally cover the whole thing with the meringue dough.
6. Put in an oven on the top shelf for about 2 minutes to give the meringue a bit of a brownish shade. Serve instantly.
