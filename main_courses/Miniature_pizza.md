# Miniature pizzas

- flatbread
- tomato sauce
- pepperoni
- grated cheese
- jalapeño slices

1. Preheat your oven to around 400 F
2. Cut the flatbread into palm-sized squares and pour some tomato sauce on each piece (ketchup will do in a pinch)
3. Place a slice of pepperoni and a heap of grated cheese on every square. If you're feeling bold top it off with a slice of jalapeño and don't say I didn't warn you
4. Bake for about 5 to 7 minutes
