DAL

INGREDIENTS
1 cup of lentils (any type)
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp of tomato paste or 1 fresh tomato 
1 chicken stock cube

1 tbsp oil
1/4 tsp whole cumin
1 onion, finely sliced
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
chillies, chopped (optional)


METHOD

1. Wash lentils well. Place in pot with garam masala, tomato paste, chicken stock cube and 2-3 cups of water. Bring to boil and then allow to simmer for 1 hour, skimming any froth off the top. At this point, you may want to puree the mixture using a stab mixer or blender, or, if you prefer your dal chunky, leave it as it is.

2. In a separate frypan, add the oil. Place on high heat, then add cumin seeds. When you can hear the cumin seeds popping, add in the onion. Wait until golden, then add chilli and garlic. Fry for a few minutes (being careful not to let the garlic burn), then add to the lentil stew.

3. Simmer the mixture for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and serve with hot roti.
