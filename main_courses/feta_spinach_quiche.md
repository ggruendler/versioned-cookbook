# crustless feta and spinach quiche



# ingredients


- eggs (5-10)
- 500 g frozen spinach
- 250 g feta cheese
- splash of milk or cream
- optional: mushrooms, onions


# instructions



1. Preheat your oven to 350 F
2. Thaw the spinach and drain it well
3. If you're so inclined, fry some diced onions and mushrooms
4. Whisk the eggs lightly and add a splash of milk - or live a little and go with cream. Season with black or white pepper. Depending on how salty the feta cheese is you may or may not want to add salt
5. Spread the spinach (and mushrooms/onions) out on the bottom of a pie dish, pour the egg mixture and crumbled feta on top
6. Bake until the top is golden brown and the center is solid. Depending on the shape of your pie dish this could take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes
